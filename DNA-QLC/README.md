# DNA-QLC: An Efficient and Reliable Image Encoding Scheme for DNA Storage

## Install
**Requirements**:
- Python, `pytorch>=1.9`, `tqdm`, `compressai` ([link](https://github.com/InterDigitalInc/CompressAI)), `timm>=0.5.4` ([link](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models)).
- Code has been tested in all of the following environments:
    - Both Windows and Linux, with Intel CPUs and Nvidia GPUs
    - Python 3.9
    - `pytorch=1.9, 1.10, 1.11` with CUDA 11.3
    - `pytorch=1.12` with CUDA 11.6, in which models run faster (both training and testing) than in previous versions.
